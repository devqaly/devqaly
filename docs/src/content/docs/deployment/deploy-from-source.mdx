title: Deploy Devqaly from source
description: Get started on how you can deploy devqaly to your own infrastructure from source
---

Deploying Devqaly involves pulling the monorepo (Backend, API, and Frontend) to your own machine and simply installing its dependencies.

Ensure that the machine running Devqaly meets the minimum specifications of `2 vCPUs`, `8 GB of RAM`, and `50 GB of storage`, as failure to meet these requirements will prevent the startup of Devqaly backend services.

These specifications are suitable for low to moderate volumes, but for high traffic expectations, scaling up is recommended from this baseline.

## Prerequisites

Devqaly has a few components to it:

- <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">VueJS app</a>: This application is responsive to display the web UI that you see when seeing a session or managing your company.
- <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel app</a>: This application is responsive to handling sessions that were recorded and managing access to sessions data.
- <a href="https://postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgresql database</a>: This is responsible to hold the data for your sessions and other management aspects of Devqaly.

Each application has its own requirement of software to be installed before being able to run it.

### VueJS app

The VueJS application has the following software requirements:

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.16.0" target="_blank">NodeJS v18.16.x</a>
- <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install" target="_blank">NPM v9.5.x</a> (although any version from 7.x to 10.x will do since we do not use any custom commands from newer versions)

### Laravel app

The backend application has the following software requirements - most of these are copied from <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/deployment#introduction">Laravel deployment guide</a>:

- PHP >= 8.1
- <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a>
- Ctype PHP Extension
- cURL PHP Extension
- DOM PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP Extension
- Filter PHP Extension
- Hash PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PCRE PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Session PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension
- <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">ffmpeg</a>

### Postgres database

To use Devqaly, ensure you have a database to store its data. We have extensively tested Devqaly with PostgreSQL and can assure seamless compatibility.
Alternatively, if you prefer, you may opt for MySQL, but remember to update the `.env` variable `DB_CONNECTION` to `mysql`.

In your postgres (or mysql) instance, you should have a database named `laravel`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE laravel;
```

## Clone repository

It's noteworthy that within our repository, there are two branches designated as protected:

- **master:** This branch houses the most recent version of Devqaly. All published versions are derived from the `master` branch.
- **next:** This branch contains code intended for upcoming releases. All beta or alpha versions are released from the `next` branch.

You can clone our repository by running the command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:devqaly/devqaly.git
```

This will clone the repository into a folder named `devqaly`.

## Backend

### Install backend packages

Under `apps/api` you will need to run the following command:

```bash
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

This command will install all backend dependencies for the Laravel application.

### Update your `.env` file

To initiate Devqaly on your self-hosted instance, it is necessary to duplicate `.env.example` located within `apps/api` and rename it as `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Several environment variables need attention and should be adjusted to suit your specific case:

- `APP_URL`: This should point to the URL where your Devqaly's api will live (e.g. https://devqaly-api.my-company.com).
- `DB_HOST`: Points to where your database is hosted. If it's local, you can set `https://localhost`.
- `DB_PORT`: Points to the port where your database is hosted. Default should be fine for postgres databases.
- `DB_DATABASE`: The database name. Default should be fine.
- `DB_USERNAME`: The database username for the user accessing your database.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The database password for the user accessing your database.
- `MAIL_MAILER`: The driver for the mailer. The default is SMTP, but we support <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">ses</a>, <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/" target="_blank">mailgun</a> and <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/" target="_blank">postmark</a>.
- `MAIL_HOST`: The URL for the host of your mailing service.
- `MAIL_PORT`: The port for the host of your mailing service.
- `MAIL_USERNAME`: The username for the host of your mailing service.
- `MAIL_PASSWORD`: The password for the host of your mailing service.
- `MAIL_ENCRYPTION`: The encryption for the host of your mailing service. Set to `null` if encryption is not necessary.
- `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`: The `from` attribute when sending emails.
- `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`: This should point to the URL where your Devqaly's frontend will live (e.g. https://devqaly.my-company.com).
- `DEVQALY_IS_SELF_HOSTING`: This should be set to `true`.

### Migrate database

Once you've installed the required packages for the backend and configured your database credentials in the `.env`
file, you can execute the database migrations under `apps/api` using:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

This will create the tables under your `DB_DATABASE`.

### Run workers in backend

To handle asynchronous tasks, certain tasks are enqueued to be processed later. To facilitate this, it's necessary to run workers using Supervisor.

Initially, you will need to install Supervisor.

```bash
sudo apt-get install supervisor
```

Supervisor configuration files are commonly stored in the `/etc/supervisor/conf.d` directory. Within this directory,
you can generate multiple configuration files to guide Supervisor on how your processes should be supervised.
For instance, let's generate a `laravel-worker.conf` file responsible for initiating and monitoring `queue:work` processes:

```text
[program:laravel-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php <root>/devqaly/apps/api/artisan queue:work sqs --sleep=3 --tries=3 --max-time=3600
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stopasgroup=true
killasgroup=true
user=user
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/user/devqaly-api.com/worker.log
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

After creating the configuration file, you can update the Supervisor configuration and initiate the processes by executing the following commands:

```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread

sudo supervisorctl update

sudo supervisorctl start "laravel-worker:*"
```

## Frontend

### Setup `.env` in your frontend

To configure environment variables in your frontend, navigate to `apps/webapp` and set up the necessary variables using:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Presently, you only need to update two variables:

- `VITE_BASE_API_URL`: This should point to the URL where your api will be hosted (e.g. https://devqaly-api.my-company.com).
- `VITE_DEVQALY_IS_SELF_HOSTING`: This should be set to `true`.

### Install frontend dependencies

Once you've configured your backend, it's time to set up your frontend application located in `apps/webapp`:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build frontend application

After installing the frontend dependencies, you can proceed to build your application located in `apps/webapp`:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Nginx

### Setup backend

When deploying your application on a server with Nginx, consider using the provided configuration file as a foundation
for setting up your web server. It is probable that customization will be necessary based on your specific server configuration.

Ensure that your web server, following the configuration provided below, directs all requests to your application's
`public/index.php` file. It is crucial to avoid moving the `index.php` file to your project's root, as serving the
application from the project root could expose sensitive configuration files to the public Internet:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name devqaly-api.my-company.com;
    root /var/www/html/devqaly-api.my-company.com/apps/api/public;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

    index index.php;

    charset utf-8;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

### Setup frontend

When deploying your application on a server with Nginx, consider using the provided configuration file as a foundation
for setting up your web server. It is probable that customization will be necessary based on your specific server configuration.

```
user  nginx;
worker_processes  1;
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}

http {
  include       /etc/nginx/mime.types;
  default_type  application/octet-stream;
  log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                    '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;
  sendfile        on;
  keepalive_timeout  65;

  server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  devqaly.my-company.com;

    location / {
      root   /var/www/html/devqaly-api.my-company.com/apps/webapp/dist;
      index  index.html;
      try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;

    location = /50x.html {
      root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup SSL/TLS

Devqaly, dealing with sensitive user data, necessitates the use of HTTPS for proper functioning. It is mandatory,
as without HTTPS, the tracker won't initiate recording. Similarly, for the dashboard, HTTPS is essential; without it,
you won't be able to replay user sessions.

To keep this tutorial concise, you can refer to the instructions on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/">Let's Encrypt's website</a> for guidance on the setup process.

:::tip[Be mindful]

You will need to setup SSL/TLS for both frontend and backend applications.

:::

## Testing

To verify that everything is functioning correctly, you can test your API endpoint by visiting `https://devqaly-api.my-company.com/api/test`.
You should receive a `200 OK` status.

For the frontend, attempt to access the application directly by navigating to `https://devqaly.my-company.com`.

## Caching your backend files

Once you've confirmed that everything is set up correctly, you can enhance the performance of your API by caching backend files.
Navigate to `apps/api` to initiate the caching process:

```bash
php artisan config:cache
  && php artisan event:cache
  && php artisan route:cache
  && php artisan view:cache
```
