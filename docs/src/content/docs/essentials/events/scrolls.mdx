> Scrolling, in the context of digital interfaces, refers to the action of moving content vertically or horizontally on a
display, typically accomplished by using a mouse wheel, touchpad, or touchscreen gestures, allowing users to navigate
through larger or overflowed portions of information.

Every scroll that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK. This helps developers understand
the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

Here's the detailed information captured when a user scrolls during a session:

- **Source**: Origin point of the event, consistently sourced from your frontend.
- **Scroll Height**: Total vertical pixels of the scrolled container.
- **Scroll Width**: Total horizontal pixels of the scrolled container.
- **Scroll Top**: Number of pixels scrolled from the top.
- **Scroll Left**: Number of pixels scrolled from the left.
