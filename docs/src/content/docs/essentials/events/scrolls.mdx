> Scrolling, in the context of digital interfaces, refers to the action of moving content vertically or horizontally on a
display, typically accomplished by using a mouse wheel, touchpad, or touchscreen gestures, allowing users to navigate
through larger or overflowed portions of information.

Every scroll that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK. This helps developers understand
the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

This is the information that is recorded when a user scrolls while in a session:

- **Source**: The source where the event is coming from. The source of this event will always come from your frontend.
- **Scroll Height**: The total vertical pixels of the container that was scrolled
- **Scroll Width**: The total horizontal pixels of the container that was scrolled
- **Scroll Top**: How many pixels scrolled from the top
- **Scroll Bottom**: How many pixels scrolled from the left
