> Resizing the screen involves adjusting the dimensions of the display window on a computer or device, either by
manually dragging the window edges or using specific controls, to change the visible area and alter the layout of
content for improved visibility or multitasking.

Every resize of the screen that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK. This helps developers understand
the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

This is the information that is recorded when a user scrolls while in a session:

- **Source**: The source where the event is coming from. The source of this event will always come from your frontend.
- **Inner Width**: The total width (in pixels) of the visible screen
- **Inner Height**: The total height (in pixels) of the visible screen
