> In the context of user interactions with a computer or device interface, a click refers to the action of pressing
and releasing a button on a pointing device, typically a mouse, often used to initiate an action or select an item.

Every click that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK. This helps developers understand
the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

Here's the detailed information captured when a user clicks during a session:

- **Source**: The originating point of the event, exclusively from your frontend.
- **Position X**: Records the X-coordinate of the click on the user's screen.
- **Position Y**: Documents the Y-coordinate of the click on the user's screen.
- **Element Classes**: Registers the classes associated with the element that the user clicked on.
- **Inner Text**: If the clicked element contains any inner text, it is recorded.
