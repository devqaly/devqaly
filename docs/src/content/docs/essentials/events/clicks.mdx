> In the context of user interactions with a computer or device interface, a click refers to the action of pressing
and releasing a button on a pointing device, typically a mouse, often used to initiate an action or select an item.

Every click that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK. This helps developers understand
the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

This is the information that is recorded when a user clicks while in a session:

- **Source**: The source where the event is coming from. The source of this event will always come from your frontend.
- **Position X**: The X position in the user's screen
- **Position Y**: The Y position in the user's screen
- **Element Classes**: The classes of the element the user have clicked on
- **Inner Text**: If the element has any inner text, it will be recorded
