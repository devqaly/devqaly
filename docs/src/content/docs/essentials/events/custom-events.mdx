Devqaly empowers you to swiftly debug issues by tracking a multitude of events. However, recognizing that every
application has unique requirements, Devqaly goes a step further, enabling you to generate custom events seamlessly
integrated into recorded sessions. In the absence of an active recording session, these custom events intelligently
discard, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in your tracking capabilities.

:::tip[Did you know?]

You can generate custom events simply by calling `createCustomEvent` from the SDK:

```ts
import { DevqalySDK } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  projectKey: 'xxxxx',
})

const eventPayload = {
  amountPaid: 10000,
  transactionId: 12
}

devqalySDK.createCustomEvent('paid-bill', eventPayload)
```

This is the information that is recorded when a custom event is generated:

- **Source**: The origin of the event, originating from either the frontend or backend.
- **Event Name**: Identifies the unique name assigned to the event.
- **Event Payload**: Encompasses the JSON payload transmitted at the creation of the custom event.
