Devqaly allows you to track many events that will help you debug your issues faster, but there are several other
events that would be important to track for each specific application.

Devqaly allows you to generate custom events that can be included in sessions when they are being recorded. If a session
is not being recorded, the event will be discarded.

:::tip[Did you know?]

You can generate custom events simply by calling `createCustomEvent` from the SDK:

```ts
import { DevqalySDK } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  projectKey: 'xxxxx',
})

const eventPayload = {
  amountPaid: 10000,
  transactionId: 12
}

devqalySDK.createCustomEvent('paid-bill', eventPayload)
```

This is the information that is recorded when a custom event is generated:

- **Source**: The source where the event is coming from. The source can be either from the frontend or backend
- **Event Name**: The name of the event
- **Event Payload**: A JSON payload that was sent when the custom event was created
