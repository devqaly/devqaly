A database transaction is a unit of work comprising one or more operations that are executed as a single,
indivisible and consistent task, ensuring data integrity and consistency in a database system.

Here are the fields that we are currently tracing whenever a database transaction happens:

- **Source**: The source where the event is coming from. Usually this will be from the single backend service you might have, but you can also
generate database transaction from other backend servers that you might have
- **Execution time (milliseconds)**: The time it took to run your database transaction
- **SQL**: The query that was used to query the database
- **Network Request**: If this database transaction happened due to an HTTP request to your backend, you will be able
to see which HTTP request have started this database transaction


:::tip[Easily find N+1 problems]

You are able to easily find N+1 problems in your application by inspecting how many database transactions have happened
during an HTTP request
