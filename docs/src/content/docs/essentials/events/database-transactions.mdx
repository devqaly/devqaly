A database transaction is a unit of work comprising one or more operations that are executed as a single,
indivisible and consistent task, ensuring data integrity and consistency in a database system.

Below are the fields we currently monitor during a database transaction:

- **Source**: Indicates the origin of the event, typically from your primary backend service.
However, it's worth noting that database transactions can also be initiated from other backend servers in your infrastructure.
- **Execution time (milliseconds)**: Represents the duration taken to execute the database transaction.
- **SQL**: Displays the query employed to interact with the database.
- **Network Request**: If the database transaction resulted from an HTTP request to your backend, you can identify
the specific HTTP request that triggered this transaction.
