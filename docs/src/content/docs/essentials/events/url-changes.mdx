> A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) change occurs when the web address in a browser's address bar is modified,
indicating a shift from the current web page to a new one, enabling navigation between different online locations.

Every URL change that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK. This helps developers understand
the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

This is the information that is recorded when a user URL changes while in a session:

- **Source**: The event's origin, always from your frontend.
- **New URL**: Captures the updated URL to which the user has navigated.
