Network requests can be made to GET information from a server, or post an information to a server. In Devqaly whenever
your application makes an HTTP request using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" target="_blank">fetch</a>
we record the information attached to that request.

Here are the fields that we are currently tracing whenever an HTTP request is done successfully:

- **Source**: The source where the event is coming from. Usually this will be from the client's browser, but you can also
generate HTTP requests from your backend to another service within your infrastructure
- **URL**: The Uniform Resource Locator that the HTTP request was made to
- **Method**: The method that was used in the HTTP request. This can be a GET, POST, DELETE and many more.
Please consult <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-methods" target="_blank">RFC 9110</a> for more methods.
- **Response Code**: The code returned by the server.
For all response codes, please consult <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml" target="_blank">IANA's documentation</a>
- **Request Headers**: The headers that were sent to the server
- **Request Body**: If the request sent to the server has any body, it will be recorded
- **Response Headers**: The headers that were returned by the server
- **Response Body**: If the server returned any body, it will be recorded

:::tip[Response Headers]

Not all response headers might be recorded. The server needs to allow the frontend to read specific headers by returning
the header <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers" target="_blank">Access-Control-Expose-Headers</a>
