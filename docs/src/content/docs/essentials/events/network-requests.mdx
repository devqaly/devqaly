Network requests serve the purpose of either fetching information from a server or posting information to it. In Devqaly,
every time your application initiates an HTTP request using the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" target="_blank">fetch</a> function, we meticulously
log the associated information.

Here are the fields we currently trace upon successful completion of an HTTP request:

- **Source**: Indicates the origin of the event, typically from the client's browser. However, it's worth noting that
HTTP requests can also be generated from your backend to interact with another service within your infrastructure.
- **URL**: Represents the Uniform Resource Locator to which the HTTP request was directed.
- **Method**: Specifies the method employed in the HTTP request, such as GET, POST, DELETE, and various others.
Refer to the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-methods" target="_blank">RFC 9110</a> for a
comprehensive list of methods.
- **Response Code**: Signifies the code returned by the server. For a detailed breakdown of all response codes, please consult <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml" target="_blank">IANA's documentation</a>.
- **Request Headers**: Encompasses the headers forwarded to the server.
- **Request Body**: Records any body accompanying the request sent to the server.
- **Response Headers**: Captures the headers returned by the server.
- **Response Body**: Documents any body provided by the server in its response.

:::tip[Response Headers]

Recording of response headers is subject to the server's permission. To enable the frontend to access specific headers,
the server must include the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers" target="_blank">Access-Control-Expose-Headers</a> header in its response.
