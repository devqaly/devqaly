Devqaly is an open-source session replay, built for engineering teams to help them build rich product
experiences without constantly reinventing the wheel.

Allow users during your staging and local development to record their screens while Devqaly records important
information to help you, as a developer to debug issues faster.

In order for Devqaly to help your teams, it needs to record events that are important for developers to debug
issues faster and easier.
