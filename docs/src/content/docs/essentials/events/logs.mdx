> Logs, in the context of computing and software, refer to recorded events or activities generated by a system,
application, or device, providing a chronological record of actions, errors, or significant occurrences for
troubleshooting, monitoring, and analysis purposes.

Every logs that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK (both frontend and backend).
This helps developers understand the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.

This is the information that is recorded when a log is created while in a session:

- **Source**: The event's origin, stemming from either the frontend or backend.
- **Level**: Indicates the severity level of the log, ranging from EMERGENCY to DEBUG.
- **Log**: Presents the actual text content of the log.
- **Network Request**: If the log resulted from an HTTP request to your backend, you can identify the specific HTTP
request responsible for creating this log.
