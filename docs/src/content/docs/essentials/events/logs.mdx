> Logs, in the context of computing and software, refer to recorded events or activities generated by a system,
application, or device, providing a chronological record of actions, errors, or significant occurrences for
troubleshooting, monitoring, and analysis purposes.

Every logs that happens during the recording of a session is recorded by Devqaly's SDK (both frontend and backend).
This helps developers understand the journey a user took and what was the cause for a certain bug.
