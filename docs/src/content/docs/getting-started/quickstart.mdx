import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Devqaly allows your QA team to record their screen while we record important information to allow developers to debug
issue faster.

# Getting started

To get started with Devqaly the first step is to install the SDK in your frontend project:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install @devqaly/browser
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @devqaly/browser
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, you can initialize the SDK in your project:

```typescript
import { DevqalySDK } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  // You can obtain the project key by visiting your project's list at
  // https://app.devqaly.com/projects
  projectKey: '<project-key>',
})

devqalySDK.showRecordingButton()
```

By adding the SDK to your frontend project, you will allow your anyone with access to the project to record a session.

:::tip[Did you know?]

You can connect your backend with your frontend. This will allow you to record `database transactions`, `logs` and
allow you to trace network requests through your infrastructure. Read more at [connect your backend](/getting-started/connect-backend/)

## Configuration

We are working hard to add new configuration methods to allow you to customize this SDK to your needs.

Currently, we allow you to add the following configurations

### Starting Devqaly only in a certain environment
We have initially built Devqaly to work either in local environment or staging. We highly recommend to do the proper
checks before initializing the SDK:

```javascript
const isStaging = process.env === 'staging'

if (isStaging) {
  const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
    projectKey: '<project-key>',
  })

  devqalySDK.showRecordingButton()
}
```

### Filter events
You are able to filter out events that should be sent to the devqaly's backend (or your own self-hosted version).

You simply have to pass a `eventFilter` when initializing the SDK:

```typescript
import { DevqalySDK, SDKEvent } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  // ...
  eventFilter: function (event: SDKEvent) {
    
  }
})
```

### Frontend Url

If you are self-hosting devqaly, you can pass the frontend URL by providing a `frontendUrl` to the configuration:

```typescript
import { DevqalySDK } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  // ...
  frontendUrl: 'https://webapp-devqaly.my-domain.com'
})
```

### API Url

If you are self-hosting devqaly, you can pass the backend URL by providing a `apiUrl` when intializing the SDK:

```typescript
import { DevqalySDK } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  // ...
  apiUrl: 'https://api-devqaly.my-domain.com'
})
```

### Disable listeners

If you would like to disable certain listeners, you can simple pass a `disabledListeners` object when initializing the SDK:

```typescript
import { DevqalySDK } from '@devqaly/browser'

const devqalySDK = new DevqalySDK({
  // ...
  disabledListeners: {
    network: false,
    click: false,
    log: false,
    resize: false,
    scroll: false,
    urlChange: false,
  }
})
```
