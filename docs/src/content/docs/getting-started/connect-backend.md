description: Check out how you can connect your backend to fully utilize the power of Devqaly

By just adding Devqaly to your frontend project you will be able to record a session and share the session with your 
colleagues. But, Devqaly allows you to collect information on the backend as well. For example, you can record:

1. Which **database transactions** happened because of a specific HTTP request to your backend
2. Which **logs** have been created because of a specific HTTP request
3. Whenever your backend crashes, Devqaly will create an event notifying that a problem happened in the session

# How to add Devqaly to your backend

We have developed a few SDKs that allow you to easily integrate Devqaly into your backend. Currently we support the 
following frameworks/languages:
