# Why

As developers, frequent communication with Quality Assurance Engineers (QAE) is a common aspect of application development.
This interaction can pose challenges, particularly when QAEs lack technical expertise.
Moreover, developers often find themselves lacking essential information crucial for effective issue debugging.

Recognizing this challenge, Devqaly aims to address the issue. We believe in fostering improved collaboration between
developers and quality assurance engineers to expedite product delivery to clients.

# How it works

Devqaly seamlessly integrates a button into your frontend application, empowering developers and
Quality Assurance Engineers (QAE) to effortlessly record their screens while pinpointing bugs or
addressing functionalities that deviate from the specified requirements.

During the bug reproduction process, Devqaly captures vital information, providing developers with the
insights needed for easy issue debugging.

For enhanced functionality, consider installing our SDK in your backend.
This unlocks Devqaly's ability to reveal resources utilized by a single network request, including:

- **Database Transactions**: Identify specific database transactions invoked during a particular request.
- **Logs**: Access information on logs generated for a specific request.
- **Exceptions**: Detect instances where your application encountered exceptions, whether from the frontend, backend, or any microservice.
