As we are currently in beta testing with invitation-only access, there won't be a signup page available for users in
your Devqaly self-hosted instance. To create your initial account in Devqaly, execute the command
`php artisan app:create:accounts:for:company` under `apps/api` when finished setting up
everything and follow the provided instructions.
